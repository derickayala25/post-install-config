<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

<br/>

<b>Acknowledge Agent and Admin panels</b><br/>
Once you log in to osTicket there are two panels which you can work in: Agent Panel and Admin Panel. You'll know which panel you're in by looking at the top right of the browser tab.
If you see Admin Panel, then you're in the Agent Panel. If you see Agent Panel, then you're in the Admin Panel.</br>

If you log in as the Administrator (instead of as an Agent), the Agent panel is for viewing and working on tickets as an Agent. In this panel you're not able to do administrative changes as in resetting passwords, adding new users, etc.

In the Admin panel, however, you have access to back-end configuration options. You can adjust system settings, add permissions, set up teams, roles, etc.

It basically breaks down as Agents have Roles (and permissions associated with those roles), Agents can be part of a Team, and a Team will be 
part of a Department or Departments.

</p><br/>


<b>Default Roles in osTicket</b></br>
The default Roles that come with osTicket are <b>View only</b>, <b>Limited Access</b>, <b>Expanded Access</b>, and <b>All Access</b>. You can find these roles with their assigned permissions by going to the <b>Admin Panel</b>, clicking on the <b>Agents</b> tab and clicking on <b>Roles</b>. You can also create new roles with their own custom permissions.

</p><br/>


<b>Default Departments in osTicket</b></br>
Default <b>Parent</b> departments that appear in osTicket are <b>Top Level Department</b>, <b>Maintenance</b>, and <b>Support</b>. You can give the same level of access to the whole <b>Department</b> or give each individual <b>Agent</b> different access permissions. If you choose <b>Top Level Department</b> as the <b>Parent</b> Department, then the new <b>Department</b> you create will be itself become a <b>Parent</b> Department.

</p><br/>

<b>Adding a new Department</b></br>
Let's create a new Department called <b>SysAdmins</b>. We'll have the <b>Top Level Department</b> as it's <b>Parent</b> and we'll leave the rest of the default settings as is.
1. In the <b>Admin Panel</b>, navigate to <b>Agents</b> > <b>Departments</b>.
2. Click on `(+) Add New Department`
3. Type <b>SysAdmins</b> in the <b>Name:</b> box
4. Click the `Create Dept` button at the bottom

</p><br/>


<b>Default Teams in osTicket</b></br>
Teams allow you to pull Agents from different Departments and organize them to handle a specific issue.

The default Team in osTicket is <b>Level 1 Support</b>. You can select a <b>Team</b> Lead and individual <b>Agent</b> members.

<p>

</p><br/>


<b>Adding a new Team</b></br>
We'll create a new team called <b>Online Banking</b>.
1. In the <b>Admin Panel</b>, navigate to <b>Agents</b> > <b>Teams</b>
2. Click on `(+) Add New Team`
3. Type <b>Online Banking</b> in the <b>Name:</b> box
4. Click the `Create Team` button at the bottom

<p>

</p><br/>


<b>Allowing end users to create tickets</b></br>
osTicket, by default, allows any end user to create tickets. However, if we want to make changes to those permissions, we can follow these steps:
1. In the <b>Admin Panel</b>, go to <b>Settings</b> > <b>Users</b>
2. In the <b>Authentication Settings</b> area, make any desired updates.

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ca59603-d4e1-48af-acf0-8e39e3df6694" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Default Roles"/>
</p><br/>


<b>Configuring Agents</b></br>
Next, we'll configure Agents. These are the actual workers/employees.
1. In the <b>Admin Panel</b>, go to <b>Agents</b>
2. Click on `(+) Add New Agent`
3. Once there, required fields are <b>First</b> and <b>Last Name</b>, <b>Email Address</b>, <b>Username</b>, <b>Primary Department</b> and <b>Role</b> (in the <b>Access</b> tab).
4. You can also set a password and assign a team, but it's not required.
5. For this example, the agent will be Jane Doe and she's part of the <b>SysAdmins</b> department. Her role has <b>Expanded Access</b> and she's also part of the <b>Online Banking</b> team.
6. Once done, click the `Create` button at the bottom

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12b0d4ab-d821-4981-a76f-3030f7ee4e17" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Default Roles"/>
</p><br/>


<b>Configuring End Users</b></br>
Next, we'll configure an end user. These are the people requesting the services, the customers.
1. In the <b>Agent Panel</b>, go to <b>Users</b> > <b>Add Users</b>
2. Required fields are <b>Email Address</b> and <b>Full Name</b>. This user will be Karen at karen@enduser.com.
3. Click on the `Add User` button

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce47116b-d8e2-4086-a357-26f0ff38728f" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Default Roles"/>
</p><br/>

<b>Configuring Service Level Agreements</b></br>
Now, we'll configure some Service Level Agreements (SLA). This is a formal contract between a service provider and a customer 
that defines the expected level of service, including specific metrics, responsibilities, and remedies if service levels are not met. 
The osTicket Default SLA has an 18 hour grace period. However, you can add new SLAs. To do this:
1. Go to the <b>Admin Panel</b> > <b>Manage</b> > <b>SLA</b> > <b>Add New SLA Plan</b>.
2. We'll <b>Name</b> the first SLA Sev-A, give it a <b>Grace Period</b> of 1 hour and put it under a 24/7 <b>Schedule</b>.
3. Click on the `Add Plan` button.
4. The second one we'll <b>Name</b> Sev-B. This one will have a <b>Grace Period</b> of 4 hours and will also have a 24/7 <b>Schedule</b>.
5. The third one we'll <b>Name</b> Sev-C and give it an 8 hour <b>Grace Period</b> and a Business Hours <b>Schedule</b>.

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/971f929a-1f37-4026-88b5-b188215fedf1" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Default Roles"/>
</p><br/>


<b>Configuring Help Topics</b></br>
Next, we'll configure Help Topics. Help Topics guide what information is gathered from Users and how tickets are routed or assigned. 
You can assign a specific department to handle a topic, add SLAs, etc. osTicket already has five <b>Parent Topics</b> built in.
For this example, we'll add five Help Topics and associate each with a Parent Topic. To do this:
1. Go to the <b>Admin Panel</b> > <b>Manage</b> > <b>Help Topics</b> > <b>Add New Help Topic</b>.
2. We'll name the first <b>Topic</b> <em>Business Critical Outage</em> and assign it's <b>Parent Topic</b> as <em>Report a Problem</em>.
3. Click on the `Add Topic` button.
4. The second <b>Topic</b> will be <em>Personal Computer Issues</em> and the <b>Parent Topic</b> will also be <em>Report a Problem</em>.
5. The third <b>Topic</b> will be <em>Equipment Request</em> with <b>Parent Topic</b> <em>General Inquiry</em>.
6. The fourth <b>Topic</b> will be <em>Password Reset</em> and we'll assign it to <em>Report a Problem/Access Issue</em>.
7. The last <b>Topic</b> that we'll add is <em>Other</em> and we'll assign it to <em>General Inquiry</em>.
8. Please note that when you add a topic, the topic itself (along with it's <b>Parent Topic</b>) will become available as a <b>Parent Topic</b> when you're ready to add the next topic.

# üß† Technologies Used
- osTicket (Help Desk Ticketing System)
- System Administration
- Microsoft Azure (Cloud computing)
- Microsoft Remote Desktop
- Internet Information Services (IIS)

# ‚öôÔ∏è Post-Installation Configuration

### üóëÔ∏è Deleting "setup" folder

To get rid of the `‚ö†Ô∏è Please take a minute to delete setup directory (../setup/) for security reasons.` message:

1. Navigate to `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket`, right-click the `setup` folder and then click `Delete`

<img src="/images/delete-setup-folder.png" alt="Delete Setup Folder">

### üëë Adding a New "Master Admin" role

Now that osTicket is successfully installed from scratch,  it is time to do some configuration and system administration work. To start this off, we will create a new Role in osTicket called "Master Admin". This will be the highest level administrator that has every single permission available to them. Roles are used to determine an Agent's permissions. Generally, most Agents will not have every single permission as the Master Admin does.

1. Open `http://localhost/osTicket/scp/logs.php` in a web browser, enter the correct credentials

2. Navigate to `Agents` > `üìã Roles` > `(+) Add New Role`

3. In the `üìÑ Definition` tab:
    - In the **Name:** field, enter the desired role. In this case, it is `Master Admin`
    - Optionally, add any desired details regarding the new role in the __*Internal Notes*__ field

4. In the `üîí Permissions` tab, give all available permissions to the Master Admin:
    - ‚úÖ `Assign ‚Äî Ability to assign tickets to agents or teams`
    - ‚úÖ `Close ‚Äî Ability to close tickets`
    - ‚úÖ `Create ‚Äî Ability to open tickets on behalf of users`
    - ‚úÖ `Delete ‚Äî Ability to delete tickets`
    - ‚úÖ `Edit ‚Äî Ability to edit tickets`
    - ‚úÖ `Edit Thread ‚Äî Ability to edit thread items of other agents`
    - ‚úÖ `Link ‚Äî Ability to link tickets`
    - ‚úÖ `Mark as Answered ‚Äî Ability to mark a ticket as Answered/Unanswered`
    - ‚úÖ `Merge ‚Äî Ability to merge tickets`
    - ‚úÖ `Post Reply ‚Äî Ability to post a ticket reply`
    - ‚úÖ `Refer ‚Äî Ability to manage ticket referrals`
    - ‚úÖ `Release ‚Äî Ability to release ticket assignment`
    - ‚úÖ `Transfer ‚Äî Ability to transfer tickets between departments`

<img src="/images/add-master-admin.png" alt="Add Master Admin">

### üñ•Ô∏è Adding a New "System Administrators" Department

Each Agent is appointed a specific department which is determined by their assigned role within the helpdesk. For now, we'll just create a "System Administrators" department where the Master Admins will be designated. Various other settings such as email settings, service level agreements (SLAs), and managers can also be configured in the `Departments` tab.

1. Navigate to `Agents` > `üßë‚Äçüíª Departments` > `(+) Add New Department`

2. In the **Name:** field, enter `System Administrators`

3. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the orange `Create Dept` button

<img src="/images/add-sys-admin-department.png" alt="Add System Administrators Department">

### ü§ù Adding a New "Level II Support" Team

 Teams enable cross-departmental collaboration by aggregating skilled agents from various units. This structure facilitates the creation of specialized groups. For instance, you can develop a help topic related to a specific product and assign it to a team of agents with expertise in that product. In this demonstration, we'll create a "Level II Support Team" to illustrate this concept.

1. Navigate to `Agents` > `üë®üèªüë®üèæ Teams` > `(+) Add New Team`

2. In the **Name:** field, enter `Level II Support`

3. At the bottom of the page, click the orange `Create Team` button

<img src="/images/add-level2-support-department.png" alt="Add Level II Support Team">

### üéüÔ∏è Allowing Non-registered Users to Create Tickets

Out-of-the-box installations of osTicket require users to be registered and logged-in before they can create tickets. Since this isn't always ideal, the setting regarding this functionality needs to be adjusted.

1. Navigate to `Settings` > `üë• Users` > Tick ‚úÖ `Require registration and login to create tickets`

2. At the bottom of the page, click the orange `Save Changes` button

<img src="/images/adjust-ticket-permissions.png" alt="Adjust Ticket Permissions">

### üìù Adding New Agents

Next, we'll proceed to create Agents. Agents  are the helpdesk staff responsible for resolving tickets. Each Agent is assigned a primary department and role for tickets within their designated area. Agents can be granted access to multiple departments, with potentially different roles in each. The Access, Permissions, and Teams tabs are used to adjust access levels, manage permissions, and assign teams for each staff member.

1. Navigate to `Agents` > `üë§ Agents` > `(+) Add New Agent`

2. In the `Account` tab, fill out the **Name:**, **Email Address:**, and **Username:** fields for the particular Agent being added. Do the same for any desired settings in the `Access` and `Permissions` tabs as well

3. At the bottom of the page, click the orange `Create` button

4. Repeat these steps until as many Agents as desired have been added

> [!NOTE]
> While creating an administrator-level Agents (e.g. System Administrators, Managers), permit them expanded access to the Support department so that they are able to assign tickets to support-level employees.

<img src="/images/add-agents.png" alt="Add Agents">

<img src="/images/agents-list.png" alt="Agents List">

### üîê Setting Agent's Passwords
1. In the Admin panel of osTicket, navigate to `Agents` > `üë§ Agents` > and then select that Agent that needs their password set
   
2. Under the **Authentication** section, click `üîÑ Set Password`
   
3. Uncheck ‚óªÔ∏è`Send the agent a password reset email`
   
4. In the `New Password` and `Confirm Password` fields, enter a matching secure password and then click the `Update` button
   
5. Verify that the ‚óªÔ∏è`Require password change at next login` is unchecked

> [!NOTE]
> The steps above outline how an admin would manually set an Agent's password. However, the two boxes that were left unchecked are alternative methods for the Agent to set their own password instead.

<img src="/images/set-agent-password.png" alt="Set Agent Password">

### üìÉ Adding Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

SLA (Service Level Agreement) Plans define the expected resolution time for specific ticket types. Each SLA incorporates a schedule and a grace period. For instance, in our example, the SEV-A (Severity A) SLA operates on a 24/7 schedule with a one-hour grace period. This structure ensures clear expectations for ticket resolution timeframes.

1. Navigate to `Manage` > `üìö SLA` > `(+) Add New SLA Plan`

2. Fill out the information in accordance to the SLA plan of choice

3. At the bottom of the page, click the orange `Add Plan` button

<img src="/images/add-SLAs.png" alt="Add SLAs">

### ‚ùì Adding Help Topics

Help Topics facilitate ticket categorization for users. For example, we can create a "Business Critical Outage" topic, which could be used for scenarios such as customers being unable to access mobile banking services. This categorization streamlines the ticket management process and prioritization.

1. Navigate to `Manage` > `‚ùì Help Topics` > `(+) Add New Help Topic`

2. In the **Topic:** field, enter the relevant information for the topic of choice

3. At the bottom of the page, click the orange `Add Topic` button

<img src="/images/add-help-topic.png" alt="Add Help Topic">
